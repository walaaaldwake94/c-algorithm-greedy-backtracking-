The head of the Computer Science department is trying to enforce a new policy for exams. He decided that friends taking the same course should not be allowed to be in the same exam room. He is aware that if all students taking the course are friends, then this means that each student will sit for the exam in a separate room! Therefore, he is quite concerned. He is looking for a way to implement this policy in the most efficient manner. Given N students, each with a set of friends, how should the students be seated such that the number of rooms used is minimized? Assume that the number of available rooms is also N (equal to the number of rooms).
